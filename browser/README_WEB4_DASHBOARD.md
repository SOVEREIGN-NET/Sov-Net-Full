##Architecture

### Frontend (Browser)
```
packages/browser/src/web4-dashboard-clean.js - Main dashboard implementation
packages/browser/public/index.html          - Entry point HTML
```

### Backend (ZHTP Node)
```
packages/core/src/bin/zhtp-node.rs          - Main ZHTP blockchain node
packages/core/src/identity.rs               - ZK-DID identity management  
packages/core/src/quantum_wallet.rs         - Quantum-resistant wallets
packages/core/src/economics.rs              - Token economics & UBI
packages/core/src/consensus.rs              - Hybrid PoS+PoStorage+PoUW consensus
```

### Cryptography
```
packages/core/src/crypto.rs                 - Post-quantum crypto primitives
packages/core/src/zk_plonky2.rs            - Zero-knowledge proof system
packages/browser/src/crypto/quantum-crypto.ts - Browser crypto interface
```

##  Technical Implementation

### Quantum-Resistant Cryptography
- **Signatures**: CRYSTALS-Dilithium (NIST standardized)
- **Encryption**: CRYSTALS-Kyber + ChaCha20-Poly1305
- **Hashing**: BLAKE3 for performance, SHA-3 for compatibility
- **ZK Proofs**: Plonky2 for fast proving, constant verification time

### Consensus Mechanism
- **Hybrid Model**: Proof-of-Stake + Proof-of-Storage + Proof-of-Useful-Work
- **Economic Incentives**: Validators earn tokens for network contributions
- **UBI Funding**: DAO fees fund universal basic income distribution
- **Deflationary**: Transaction fees burned to maintain token value

### Network Architecture
- **Mesh Topology**: Peer-to-peer with automatic routing
- **ISP Bypass**: Direct device-to-device connectivity (WiFi, Bluetooth LE, LoRa)
- **Content Distribution**: DHT-based unified storage system
- **Privacy**: All traffic encrypted with zero-knowledge metadata protection

##  Key Innovations

### 1. Complete Internet Replacement
Unlike Web3 which still relies on HTTP/DNS, ZHTP is a completely new protocol stack that replaces the entire internet infrastructure with quantum-safe, privacy-first alternatives.

### 2. Automatic Citizen Onboarding
When you create a ZK-DID, the system automatically:
- Creates quantum-resistant wallets
- Registers for DAO governance
- Enrolls in UBI program
- Grants access to all Web4 services
- Sets up privacy-preserving credentials

### 3. Economic Model Integration
Every network action has economic incentives:
- **Routing**: Earn tokens for packet forwarding
- **Storage**: Earn tokens for hosting content
- **Validation**: Earn tokens for consensus participation
- **Content**: Earn tokens for valuable contributions
- **Governance**: Earn tokens for DAO participation

### 4. True Zero-Knowledge Privacy
Unlike blockchain "privacy" solutions, ZHTP implements comprehensive ZK:
- **Identity**: Selective disclosure without revealing private data
- **Transactions**: Amount and sender/receiver privacy
- **Communication**: Metadata protection for all interactions
- **Governance**: Anonymous voting with proof of eligibility

##  Getting Started

### 1. Launch the Dashboard
```bash
cd packages/browser
npm start
```

### 2. Create Your ZK-DID
- Click "Create New Identity" 
- System generates quantum-resistant keypair
- Automatic citizen onboarding begins
- Wallets, DAO, and UBI setup automatically

### 3. Explore Web4
- Navigate to social.zhtp, whisper.zhtp, marketplace.zhtp
- Experience true peer-to-peer internet
- Participate in DAO governance
- Earn ZHTP tokens for network contributions

### 4. Run Your Own Node (Optional)
```bash
cd packages/core
cargo run --bin zhtp-node
```
